Command line to merger:

swagger-merger -i ./app/swagger/swagger_merge.json -o ./app/lib/swagger.json



If I run the swagger-merge command and get an error like:
"swagger-merger : File C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\npm\swagger-merger.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled  on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at ..."


The way to fix the error is as follows: 
Open powershell in administrative mode and run the following command:

"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"

Choose yes or yes to all
